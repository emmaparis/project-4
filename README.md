## Description

For this project, we were instructed to build a code quiz. My motivation was to deploy all of the tools we've learned in class, and develop a product that I am proud of to display on my GitHub for future employers. This solves multiple problems, but one that I endured and fidured out upon research was how to impliment a timer to my quiz. 


## Installation

To create this application, I first created a GitHub repo and cloned into my local computer and added the files and assets folder, containing the javascript and css files. I then created my first attempt at the coding challenge which would break, but with the help of more knoledgeable tutors, my code resulted in a clean run. 

## Usage

For this site, the user will click the start button and the quiz begins. I added a few questions and four multiple choice answers to create the finished product. Upon taking the quiz, the user may notice a timer. After completion, the score board displays their score and asks for their name to be stored in the system's local storage.
